 # Stocks
 You should 'pod install' before run the app.
 
 
This is project for tinkoff fintech, IOS. The application is capable of requesting and displaying information on a stocks selected by the user. I made Russian and English localizations.

When you launch app for the first time the app will show you how to use it:

Then, you can select the company you are interested in and see how much its share is worth and how much it has risen / fallen in price recently. The application supports two themes: dark and light.
